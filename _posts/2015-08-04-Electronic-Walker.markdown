One of my favorite things to do is to help people explore avenues of creation that they would normally not try out. While working with one of my colleges at a retreat hackathon, we started talking about different technologies besides the standard HTML/CSS/JS Stack. 

To me, tangible devices are incredibly satisfying, being able to take something from conception to creation is awesome. So I was trying to steer him away from just designing something locked in his computer. One thing that he was interested in was Theo Jansen's Strand Beests.![Strand Beast]({{ site.url }}/images/strandbeast_image.jpg) 

These amazing devices are created from genetic algorithms which optimized different lengths for walking. [An excellent explanation is available from Theo Jansen himself on his website](http://www.strandbeest.com/beests_leg.php).

So we spent a couple hours calculating the proper lengths and then used Solidworks to design all the necessary parts. 

Once we designed everything, I made an animation of the assembly in Solidworks just to prove that the concept worked by spinning just the central circle. Once we were satisfied with all of those values, we went to go make them.

That same night, in the dark hours of The Invention Lab, we converted our drawings over to a usable format, and then cut them up on the laser cutter. 1/8" acrylic gave us a nice combination of easy workability (laser cutting) and strength. Plus it came in blue! So we cut and began assembly. ![Strand Beast parts 0]({{ site.url }}/images/strandbeast_parts0.jpg)

To affix everything, we used small tubes of polystyrene that was slightly smaller than the holes. Polystyrene being smooth on the outside gave us a nice "friction-less" bearing so the parts could move without really relying on any special moving parts. ![Strand Beast parts 1]({{ site.url }}/images/strandbeast_parts1.jpg). With those in place, we wanted to make sure that it had was actually put together properly, so we built one set of legs and then tried it out.

So that instilled enough confidence for us to continue. So we put everything together and got a nice prototype. ![Strand Beast parts 3]({{ site.url }}/images/strandbeast_parts3.jpg)

The next problem we had is that because of these "friction-less" tubes, they would occasionally slip out of their holes, so I designed a plug which would pressure fit into the tube and keep it locked within the fit.

It took two or three prints to get the shape just right due to the inconsistencies of the printer filament but a couple test fits and some filing made it fit just right.

And then the final put together product.

We called it the "Zhenzhu" because we designed and built it during our internal hackathon, Boba Hacks.
